Hey everyone! 


I created an git exercise with Html&CSS.  so far I act as programmer 1 and completed step 1-8 in Part from the course ( as per link below) 
https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/workshops/git-workflow/

Currently I am waiting for my pull request to be approved and merge by programmer 2.   As we have more than 2 programmers in this exercise. I suggest someone can act as a manager to act on the first approval/ merge and then allocate the tasks for other programmers. 

The website I set-up have 3 poteintal issues to solve ( can also add another issue such as centeralise the title ..etc )
