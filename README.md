## Repo History

- **Jason**: I added a protection to the main branch so that it can only be merged into when someone else has reviewed a pull request

## Game History

### 1. Fran's update

I have merged your pull request and have added some html for you to check ðŸ™‚. Happy coding!

#### 1A. Jason's Review

## Chat

- **Lucien:** @jason I don't know why i can't see your branch being merge to the main but i did see your change somewhere. Git is very naughty
  - **Jason:** I didn't merge anything, I only reviewed and commented!
