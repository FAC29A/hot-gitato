Let's learn whilst being deceptive!

## Game Rules

### General Idea

Ideally, we want multiple issues & branches occurring in parallel. By the time a branch has come up with a working fix to an issue, there's probably new changes on the `main` branch that will need to be pulled and reconciled.

### Player Roles

In any moment, players are being one of the following:

1. Chaos Gremlin
2. Demanding Capitalist
3. Judgemental Rival

   <summary>What Should I Do Right Now?</summary>

   You do you, but here's a suggested flow that'll keep the game going

   - If there are Pull Requests in need of review, be a Judgemental Rival
   - If there's fewer than 2 open issues, be a Demanding Capitalist
   - If there are at least 2 open issues, be a Chaos Gremlin

</details>

   - Create an issue asking for a particular feature, update or change
   - This repo is for practicing Git flow rather than flexing our code muscles, so keep the requests reasonable.

   <summary>How to Be a Chaos Gremlin</summary>

   1. Pick an open issue. Assign yourself to the issue.
   2. Create a branch and name it something relevant
   3. Come up with a fix for the issue in your branch.
   4. For extra points, simultaneously create a new problem in your code, so that a future issue can be raised in the game
   5. Go through the usual steps (pull from main, reconcile changes, stage, commit, push) in whatever coding environment you're using
   6. Create a Pull Request and request any players you'd like to review the code

</details>

   <summary>How to Be a Judgemental Rival</summary>

   1. Review the code
   2. If there are changes required, either...
      - Edit the commit directly (and someone else will review it)
      - Request Changes via the review screen

</details>

### Game Maintenance

- If an issue is revolved, close it
- Delete your own old branches if you're done with them

## Repo History

- **Jason**: I added a protection to the main branch so that it can only be merged into when someone else has reviewed a pull request
